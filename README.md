This is a simple Firefox theme that includes just the basic needed things for a better Firefox experience it also includes a user.js file using Betterfox

<br>
<hr>
The theme was made by Eric Murphy (his GitHub ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz) and the original theme is in his GitHub profile. The user.js file is a code from BetterFox which can be found on GitHub 

also, a disclaimer I put BetterFox in here not because it is a part of the theme but because it is a good security resource to make your browser and browsing experience more private you can easily remove it yourself if you do not want it

- FirefoxTheme ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/userChrome.css
