This is a simple firefox theme that includes just the basic needed things for a better firefox experience it also includes a user.js file using betterfox

<br>
<hr>
The theme was made by [Eric Murphy](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz) and the original theme isin his github profile. While the user.js file is a code from BetterFox which can be found on github

also I disclaimer I put betterfox in here not becuase its a part of the theme but because it isa good security resourse to make your browser and browsing experience more private but you can easily remove it yourself if you dont want it
