This is a simple Firefox theme that includes just the basic needed things for a better Firefox experience it also includes a user.js file using Betterfox

<br>
<hr>
The original theme was made by Eric Murphy (his GitHub ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz) and the original theme is in his GitHub profile. The user.js file is a code from BetterFox which can be found on GitHub. Also if you want to learn more I encourage you to look at Eric Murphy's YouTube that's where I learned this. Even tho he isn't making coding content directly he is making tech-related content which I think everyone should check out. Eric Murphy's YouTube ðŸ‘‰ https://www.youtube.com/@EricMurphyxyz

also, a disclaimer I put BetterFox in here not because it is a part of the theme but because it is a good security resource to make your browser and browsing experience more private you can easily remove it yourself if you do not want it.
